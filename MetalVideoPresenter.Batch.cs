// commands: commit overhead dominated CPU time for scenes with dozens of draws
// per frame. Ordering inside the batch is by encoder sequence (snapshot blits
// for a draw's feedback reads are encoded before its render pass opens), and
// everything that must observe batched work on the serial queue — flips, image
// writes/blits, CPU-visible write-backs, the present pass — flushes first.
