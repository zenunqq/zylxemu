/// <remarks>
/// This is intentionally coarse-grained: it exposes the entry and exit of each
/// dispatched frame rather than per-instruction stepping. Per-instruction
/// control requires cooperation from the native execution backend and is layered
/// on top of this seam as the backend gains support; keeping the dispatcher-level
/// contract stable lets the debugger infrastructure exist independently of that
/// work. Implementations must be thread-safe: frames may be dispatched from the
/// dedicated emulation thread while a debug server services clients on its own
/// threads.
