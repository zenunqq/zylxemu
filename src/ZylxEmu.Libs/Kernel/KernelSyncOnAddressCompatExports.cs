// libKernel's address-wait primitives (sceKernelSyncOnAddress*) are the PS5's
// futex-style wait/wake: a thread parks on a guest address until another thread
// wakes that address. Guest runtimes (seen driving Juicy Realm, PPSA19268)
// build their own spinlocks/queues on top of it and call the wait in a hot
// loop; left unimplemented, every wait returns immediately and the runtime
// busy-spins forever (millions of calls, no forward progress).
//
// This implements wait/wake over the existing cooperative-block scheduler,
// keyed on the address. The real primitive takes a compare value so the wait
// only sleeps while the address still holds the expected value; that exact
// value is not recovered here, so each wait is given a bounded deadline and
// treated as a spurious-wakeup-tolerant park: a genuinely missed wake
// self-heals when the deadline expires and the guest re-checks its own
// condition, which futex callers already tolerate. A matching wake releases
// waiters immediately through the same key.

    // large: a short interval turns every parked waiter into a hot re-poll that
